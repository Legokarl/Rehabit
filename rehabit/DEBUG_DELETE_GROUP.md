# 🔍 Debug Delete Group Issue - Step by Step

## Step 1: Open Browser Console

1. Press **F12** (or Right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Keep it open

---

## Step 2: Run This Debugging Script

**Copy and paste this ENTIRE script into the browser console and press Enter:**

```javascript
// Debug Delete Group Issue
console.log("=== GROUP DELETE DEBUGGER ===");

// Check if user is logged in
const checkAuth = () => {
  const userStr = localStorage.getItem('user');
  if (!userStr) {
    console.error("❌ NOT LOGGED IN - No user in localStorage");
    return null;
  }
  
  try {
    const user = JSON.parse(userStr);
    console.log("✅ Logged in as:", user.uid);
    console.log("   Email:", user.email);
    return user.uid;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("❌ Error parsing user data:", e);
    return null;
  }
};

const userId = checkAuth();

if (userId) {
  console.log("\n--- COPY YOUR USER ID ---");
  console.log("Your User ID:", userId);
  console.log("(Copy this to compare with group createdBy field)");
  console.log("\n");
}

// Instructions
console.log("=== NEXT STEPS ===");
console.log("1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/");
console.log("2. Select 'rehabit-5f390' project");
console.log("3. Click 'Firestore Database'");
console.log("4. Find the 'groups' collection");
console.log("5. Click on the group you want to delete");
console.log("6. Check the 'createdBy' field");
console.log("7. Compare it with your User ID above");
console.log("\n");
console.log("If they DON'T match → You didn't create this group → Can't delete");
console.log("If they DO match → There's a different issue → Continue debugging");
console.log("\n");
console.log("=== END DEBUGGER ===");
```

---

## Step 3: Verify Group Ownership

After running the script above:

1. **Copy your User ID** from the console
2. Go to **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
3. Select project: **rehabit-5f390**
4. Click **Firestore Database**
5. Click **groups** collection
6. Find the group you're trying to delete
7. Check the **`createdBy`** field

### **Do they match?**

**YES - They match:**
- You ARE the creator
- Continue to Step 4

**NO - They don't match:**
- You are NOT the creator
- You CANNOT delete this group
- Use "Leave Group" or "Delete for Me" instead

---

## Step 4: Try Deleting Again (With Console Open)

1. Keep browser console open (F12)
2. Go to the group you want to delete
3. Click **⋮** (three dots)
4. Click **"Delete Group"**
5. Confirm the deletion

### **Watch the console for these logs:**

**Expected (Success):**
```
Starting group deletion: [groupId]
Fetching messages to delete...
Found X messages to delete
Deleting message: [messageId]
Deleting message: [messageId]
...
All messages deleted
Deleting group document...
Group document deleted successfully
```

**Or (Error):**
```
Error deleting group: [Error object]
Error code: permission-denied
Error message: Missing or insufficient permissions
```

---

## Step 5: Analyze the Error

### **Error: `permission-denied`**

**Possible Causes:**

#### **A. Rules Not Applied Yet**
- Firebase rules can take up to 1 minute to apply
- **Solution:** Wait 2 minutes, then try again

#### **B. Wrong Rules Deployed**
**Check in Firebase Console:**
1. Firestore Database → Rules
2. Look for line 70-73 in `groupMessages`:
   ```javascript
   allow delete: if request.auth != null && (
     resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
     get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(resource.data.groupId)).data.createdBy == request.auth.uid
   );
   ```
3. Verify it has the `||` (OR) condition
4. If not, re-paste the rules from `rehabit/firestore.rules`

#### **C. Browser Cache**
**Clear and retry:**
```
1. Close browser completely
2. Reopen browser
3. Go to app
4. Log out
5. Log in again
6. Try deleting
```

#### **D. Auth Token Expired**
**Refresh auth:**
```
1. Log out of the app
2. Close browser
3. Reopen browser
4. Log in again
5. Try deleting
```

---

### **Error: `not-found`**

**Causes:**
- Group already deleted
- Group ID is wrong

**Solution:**
- Refresh the page
- Check if group still exists in Firestore

---

### **Error: No error, but group not deleted**

**Causes:**
- JavaScript error preventing execution
- Network issue
- Group locked/in use

**Solution:**
1. Check console for ANY red errors
2. Copy the FULL error message
3. Check network tab (F12 → Network)
4. Look for failed requests (red)

---

## Step 6: Advanced Debugging

If delete still doesn't work, run this in console:

```javascript
// Advanced Group Delete Test
console.log("=== TESTING DELETE PERMISSIONS ===");

// Get current user
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user') || '{}');
console.log("Your User ID:", user.uid);

// Instructions to manually test in Firestore
console.log("\n--- MANUAL TEST IN FIREBASE ---");
console.log("1. Go to Firebase Console");
console.log("2. Click Firestore Database → Data");
console.log("3. Find 'groups' collection");
console.log("4. Find the group you want to delete");
console.log("5. Hover over the group document");
console.log("6. Click the ⋮ menu");
console.log("7. Click 'Delete document'");
console.log("8. If it deletes → Rules work, code issue");
console.log("9. If it fails → Rules issue or permission problem");
```

---

## Step 7: Check Firestore Rules Status

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Click **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
3. Look at the top-right corner
4. Check the status:

**"Published successfully"** ✅
- Rules are active
- Wait 1 minute and try again

**"Publishing..."** ⏳
- Rules still deploying
- Wait until it says "Published successfully"

**"Error"** ❌
- Syntax error in rules
- Check the error message
- Fix syntax and republish

---

## Step 8: Verify Exact Rules

**Copy this into Firebase Console Rules editor:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Groups collection
    match /groups/{groupId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid
                    && request.resource.data.name is string
                    && request.resource.data.name.size() > 0
                    && request.resource.data.name.size() <= 100;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Group Messages collection
    match /groupMessages/{messageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
                    && request.resource.data.message is string
                    && request.resource.data.message.size() > 0
                    && request.resource.data.message.size() <= 500;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && (
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(resource.data.groupId)).data.createdBy == request.auth.uid
      );
      allow update: if false;
    }
    
    // ... rest of your rules ...
  }
}
```

**Important:** Make sure to keep all your other rules (users, habits, messages, etc.)

## 🆘 If Nothing Works

### **Please provide these details:**

1. **Your User ID** (from Step 2)
2. **Group's createdBy field** (from Firebase Console)
3. **Do they match?** (Yes/No)
4. **Console error** (copy entire error message)
5. **Screenshot of Firestore Rules** (from Firebase Console)
6. **When did you deploy rules?** (time)
7. **Did you see "Published successfully"?** (Yes/No)

### **Quick Temporary Fix:**

If you need to delete the group NOW:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Firestore Database → Data
3. Find the group in `groups` collection
4. Manually delete the group document
5. Go to `groupMessages` collection
6. Filter by `groupId == [your group id]`
7. Delete all message documents
8. Refresh your app

## 🎯 Most Common Issues

**90% of the time, the issue is ONE of these:**

1. **Not the group creator** → Use "Delete for Me" instead
2. **Rules not deployed** → Re-deploy and wait 1 minute
3. **Browser cache** → Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
4. **Auth token expired** → Log out and log in
5. **Wrong rules** → Copy from `rehabit/firestore.rules` exactly

Try these five things first!
