## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "Delete Group" button not working**

**Possible Causes:**
- Not the group creator
- Permission denied
- Network error

**How to Check:**
1. Look in console for error messages
2. Check if you see: `permission-denied`
3. Verify you created the group (check createdBy field)

**Solution:**
- Only the person who **created** the group can delete it permanently
- If you're not the creator, use "Leave Group" or "Delete for Me"

---

### **Issue 2: Group still appears after deletion**

**Possible Causes:**
- Page not refreshed
- Firestore still syncing
- Delete operation failed silently

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Log out and log back in
4. Check if error message appeared

---

### **Issue 3: Missing menu options**

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Group Creator** sees:
  - Invite Members
  - Delete Group (red)

- **Regular Member** sees:
  - Invite Members
  - Delete for Me (orange)
  - Leave Group (yellow)

**If options are missing:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Check console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify you're logged in
4. Check if `isGroupCreator()` function is working

---

### **Issue 4: Permission Denied Error**

**Console shows:** `permission-denied`

**Causes:**
- Trying to delete a group you didn't create
- Firestore rules blocking the operation
- Not authenticated

**Solution:**
1. Verify Firestore rules are deployed:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. Check Firestore Rules in Firebase Console:
   - Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
   - Verify this rule exists:
   ```
   match /groups/{groupId} {
     allow delete: if request.auth != null 
                   && resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
   }
   ```

---

### **Issue 5: Messages not deleting**

**Console shows:** Messages found but deletion fails

**Solution:**
1. Check Firestore rules for groupMessages:
   ```
   match /groupMessages/{messageId} {
     allow delete: if request.auth != null 
                   && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
   }
   ```

2. This might need updating to:
   ```
   match /groupMessages/{messageId} {
     allow delete: if request.auth != null && (
       resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
       get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(resource.data.groupId)).data.createdBy == request.auth.uid
     );
   }
   ```
